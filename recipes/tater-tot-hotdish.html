    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 cups chopped yellow onion</li>
      <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>2 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
      <li>2 cups frozen cut green beans, thawed</li>
      <li>2 cups frozen sweet corn, thawed</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds frozen tater tots</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt (such as Lawry's)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>2 small scallions, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)</li>
      <li>
        Set a large deep cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil
        and swirl to coat skillet evenly. Add onions to skillet in one even
        layer; top with ground beef, breaking it up into small pieces. Cook
        undisturbed until onions are translucent, about 2 minutes. Stir beef and
        onions until well combined, and cook until beef is cooked through and
        browned, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes longer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium. Season beef with garlic powder, onion powder, and
        black pepper. Cook, stirring often, for 1 more minute. Remove from heat.
        Add cream of mushroom soup, green beans, and corn; stir until well
        combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toss tater tots and seasoned salt in a bowl to combine. Arrange tater
        tots decoratively over beef mixture in the skillet, avoiding large gaps
        between tots.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until tater tots are golden and crisp, about
        1 hour. Sprinkle with cheese and scallions; cool 10 minutes before
        serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
